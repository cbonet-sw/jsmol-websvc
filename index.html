    <h3>jsmol-websvc : embedding the JSmol viewer in a web page</h3>
    <p>
      This project site serves as a location for hosting a JSmol service for visualising crystal structures and molecules.
      JSmol is a pure Javascript and HTML5 implementation of the original Jmol Java desktop application and browser Java applet.
      JSmol is more suited to platforms (eg. Android and iOS smartphones) that run browsers which do not implement the Java applet feature.
      For further information, please see the <a href="https://jmol.sourceforge.net/">JSmol documentation</a> and <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_Applet">
      Jmol wiki</a>. There is also a <a href="https://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/chemmodels/jmolapps/methods.html">useful example of embedding the JSmol viewer in a webpage</a> hosted at Newcastle University.
      You might be interested in the demo page within this site at <a href="https://cbonet-sw.github.io/jsmol-websvc/demo/">https://cbonet-sw.github.io/jsmol-websvc/demo/</a> to get you started.
